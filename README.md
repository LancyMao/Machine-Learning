Building supervised learning models (both regression and classification) using R

## Project: Click_Through_Competition
This project involves predicting clicks for on-line advertisements. The training data consists of data for 9 days from October 21, 2014 to October 29, 2014. The criterion used to evaluate the performance is log-loss. 
We used lasso regression, K-nearest Neighbor Classification, Decision Tree Classification and ensemble method to predict the probability of clicks.

## Project: Spam_Filtering
This project involves predicting spam emails. 
There are two parts: 
1: used feature selection, naive bayes model, logistic regression, random forest model, and ensemble method; 
2: used regularized models with penalties--lasso and ridge regression.

## Exercise: Breast_Cancer_Prediction
This exercise involves predicting breast cancer.

The dataset on breast cancer research is from http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Breast+Cancer+Wisconsin+%28Original%29. Specifically, click on the “Data Folder” link on the above page and download the following two files: (i) file “breast-cancer-wisconsin.data”, which contains the actual data, and (ii) file “breast-cancer-wisconsin.names”, which contains the description of the data. This dataset has 699 records, each record representing a different case of breast cancer. Each case is described with 11 attributes (indicated in the aforementioned .names file): attribute 1 represents case id, attributes 2-10 represent various physiological characteristics, and attribute 11 represents the type (benign or malignant). 

Performed a predictive modeling analysis on this same dataset using the decision tree, the k-NN technique and the logistic regression technique.

## Exercise: Customer_Spending_Prediction
This project involves predicting customer spending.

This dataset is provided on the course website and contains data about whether or not different consumers made a purchase in response to a test mailing of a certain catalog and, in case of a purchase, how much money each consumer spent. The data file has a brief description of all the attributes in a separate worksheet. Note that this dataset has two possible outcome variables: Purchase (0/1 value: whether or not the purchase was made) and Spending (numeric value: amount spent).

Used Rapidminer to build numeric prediction models that predict Spending based on the other available customer information. Used linear regression, k-NN, and regression tree techniques.
